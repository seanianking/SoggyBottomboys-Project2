                  and file structure. I am originally from Southern California and moved to Utah to begin my career. I
                  started into programming to really push my career to a new level and keep my own self progressing.

                  I am Sean King, and I was primarily assigned to making this project look good with coding our CSS,
                  including selecting our framework, Bulma, and making sure that the HTML worked effectively within that
                  framework. I was born and raised in Provo, Utah, and achieved a degree from the University of Utah in
                  Health, Society, and Policy. My biggest hobbies are attending nerd conventions, playing Dungeons &
                  Dragons and other table top games, but most of all spending time with my wife and little daughter. I
                  started in coding because I'm always looking for something interesting and challenging, and wanted to
                  push myself to a new level in a new career.

                  My name is Tucker Vassau, and I was in charge of the JavaScript portion of the project. My
                  responsibilities included making sure the API calls were functioning as intended, and creating the
                  code that would enable the various functions for the website to work. A little bit about myself: I was
                  born and raised in a place called Mercer Island in Washington. I grew up playing lots of sports, and
                  enjoying my time being outside. I came to Utah, and attended BYU where I received my Bachelor's degree
                  in economics. Quickly after graduation, I realized that I wanted to work doing something with
                  computers where I would be able to create, and use my creativity, hence how I ended up in this class!
                  I took this class because I was interested in becoming a web developer, and wanted to gain the
                  practical skills necessary to enter the field I wanted to be in.

                  created using Passport.js.
