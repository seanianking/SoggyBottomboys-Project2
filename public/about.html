                                        My Name is Nicolaus Thomas. I was the Database guy for the project and also was responsible for the "Contact" and "About us" static pages.  I enjoyed programming in MySQL, and Sequelize.  I find backend development really fun and challenging. I am originally from Southern California and moved to Utah to begin my career. I started into programming to really push my career
                                        to a new level and keep my own self progressing.

                                        I am Sean King, and I had two main assignments to work on for this project. The first was working as our DevOps engineer, so I hosted our repository on GitHub, made set up processes to avoid merge conflicts as much as possible, work with the other engineers
                                        to resolve any conflicts that came up either from merging or from the CI that I installed for the project, and merging many of the branches that we used. The second responsibility that I had was to design the UI/UX
                                        portion of the project, including the color scheme selection and layout of many of the pages. I was born and raised in Provo, Utah, and achieved a degree from the University of Utah in Health, Society, and Policy.
                                        My biggest hobbies are attending nerd conventions, playing Dungeons & Dragons and other table top games, but most of all spending time with my wife and little daughter. This adventure in coding has been incredible
                                        so far, and I'm excited to see where this winding road continues to take me.

                                        My name is Tucker Vassau, and I was in charge of the JavaScript portion of the project. My responsibilities included making sure the API calls were functioning as intended, and creating the code that would enable the various functions for the website
                                        to work. A little bit about myself: I was born and raised in a place called Mercer Island in Washington. I grew up playing lots of sports, and enjoying my time being outside. I came to Utah, and attended BYU where
                                        I received my Bachelor's degree in economics. Quickly after graduation, I realized that I wanted to work doing something with computers where I would be able to create, and use my creativity, hence how I ended up
                                        in this class! I took this class because I was interested in becoming a web developer, and wanted to gain the practical skills necessary to enter the field I wanted to be in.
